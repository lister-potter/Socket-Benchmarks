Instruction: MUST follow all of Guidelines

You are an experienced requirements engineer. Your goal is to brainstorm a list of requirements that specify desired LLM behaviors for the given task.

These requirements should identify behaviors that, if omitted, would likely frustrate or annoy users -- such as forgetting to surface important reminders, warnings, or common-sense.

These requirements should be consistent with each other without contradictions and complementary to existing requirements.

Guidelines:
- Each requirement should test exactly ONE requirement
- Requirements should be easily verifiable, almost as if writing a Boolean condition in Python. They should be testable with Python code or an LLM itself (no human judgment or external sources needed).
- Requirements should not be overly general (i.e. they should not be universal requirements that might apply to any reasonable reasponse)
- Requirements should be generally applicable for responses to that task, not referring to any specific response
- Avoid unrealistic edge cases - focus on plausible failures that could occur even in aligned or well-trained LLMs.
- Focus only on objective, measurable requirements
- Use concise and unambiguous language
- Never generate similar requirements to the existing requirements
